Whistlerr
=========

Whistlerr is a whistle detection program which uses HTML5 WebAudio API which implements M. Nilsson's research paper - "[Human Whistle Detection and Frequency Estimation][1]". Although it's accurate, it may fail against significant background noise. [Demo here][2].

How it works?
=============

The basic idea is to detect the high energy spikes in the band of 500-5000Hz where most people blow whistles.
